Cloudflare Worker entry: an OAuth-wrapped MCP server whose one declarative route table is the whole HTTP surface.

## Components

### Mnemion  `.`
Cloudflare Worker entry: an OAuth-wrapped MCP server whose one declarative route table is the whole HTTP surface.

_why:_ The worker entry keeps the entire HTTP surface as one scannable declarative route table (method, pattern, auth gate, handler per line) so the system's shape is graspable from the declarations alone, per the "code as schematic" principle. OAuthProvider wraps the worker to own the OAuth 2.1 / DCR / token flow and intercept `/mcp`, `/token`, `/register` before dispatch, so the rest of the code never re-implements auth plumbing.

_works when:_
- src/index.ts exists at root
- wrangler.toml exists at root
- README.md exists at root
- src/index.ts imports @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider

_files:_ `index.ts`, `vite.canvas.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `vite.fragment.ts`, `vite.preview.ts`, `vite.web.ts`, `store.ts`, `worker-configuration.d.ts`

### Hive  `entities/Hive`
The single per-user Durable Object that owns all SQLite data and funnels every agent write through one kernel-enforced chokepoint.

_why:_ HiveDO is the single Durable Object that owns the SQLite store; every write funnels through its `mutate`/`batchMutate`/`processInput`/`consumeUpload` chokepoints precisely so the kernel-write boundary is enforced in one place instead of re-derived per call site. `policy.ts` is the dependency-free leaf source of truth for "which patterns agents can write, through which path, what gate fires" — unclassified kernel patterns fail CLOSED (System → denied) so a new pattern can never silently become agent-writable, and kernel/prime/ingress gates all derive from it so the boundary cannot drift between layers. Kernel COLUMNS get the same single-source treatment as kernel patterns. `kernel-columns.ts` is the dependency-free SSOT for the seven auto-provided columns; every "the kernel columns" or named-slice need (the data engine's create-exclude/facet-skip sets, the schema display, the history-diff ignore set) is DERIVED from it by filter, never re-listed, so a slice can't drift from the source. The **facet/kernel-column collision** invariant rides on that: a user-proposed facet may not be named after a kernel column (it would shadow the auto-added column on the same table), and the reservation at the `propose_change` chokepoint (`validateFacets`, reached by BOTH create_pattern and add_facet) is the FULL `KERNEL_COLUMN_SET` — deliberately NOT a narrowed subset. A subset was the historical bug (it omitted `version`/`created_by`/`updated_by`, so those three were nameable as facets). Because the reservation IS the kernel column set, adding a kernel column auto-reserves it, and the `facet-kernel-collision totality` oracle iterates `KERNEL_COLUMNS` asserting every one is rejected on both paths — so the under-coverage is impossible to reintroduce without failing the suite. The agent-facing WRITE surface reaches the engine over two transports — the interactive MCP `mutate` tool (`entities/Session/session.ts`) and the browser-authenticated `/api/mutate`. The *gating DECISIONS* those transports share — which gate a single op must clear (`mutateGate`: patch-reject vs. consent round-trip vs. pass), which op may not ride inside a batch (`findGatedBatchOp`), and how loosely-typed tool input normalizes (`normalizeMutateData`/`isSingleOpData`) — live in `mutate-gate.ts` as PURE derivations of `policy.ts`, not inline imperative branches in the MCP handler. That removes the real drift vector (an `/api`+RPC test passing while the MCP Zod/consent layer silently breaks): the decision has one tested home. The interactive consent round-trip MECHANICS (`checkAndArmConsent` + re-issue) stay in `session.ts` because only the MCP path can satisfy them; `mutate-gate.ts` decides WHETHER the round-trip fires, never how. `/api` stays owner-implicit (a logged-in human IS the consent) and does not consult the consent decision. Reads share the SAME boundary, on the same flag. `DataContext.trusted` is required and gates kernel access symmetrically: an untrusted context (`!trusted`) may neither write a kernel pattern nor read one. The trust decision is a CAPABILITY, not a per-call-site convention: `HiveDO` exposes two named constructors over a trust-agnostic `ctxFields` — `ownerDataCtx` (the ONLY `trusted: true`) and `servedDataCtx` (`trusted: false`) — and there is no trust parameter to dial at a call site. Served/untrusted reads (public page chart/metric, OG card, publication source, `/o/entry`) AND untrusted writes (ingress, upload) go through `servedDataCtx`, where the `data.ts` engine refuses any kernel pattern — so a serve/ingress sink physically cannot read or write `_access_tokens`/`_members`/etc. ALL served public reads — the public-page + OG-card render orchestration AND `getSharedEntry`/`resolvePublication`/`resolveOutput`/`getInputVisibility` — live in one module (`served.ts`), handed a narrow `ServedContext` that exposes ONLY the served reader (`servedQuery`) for user-pattern data plus a small set of bound kernel-CONFIG lookups (each returning ONE specific answer — a `_shared` visibility, a `_publications`/`_outputs`/`_inputs` config row, supersession ids, facet metadata) — never `db`, never a trusted context, no way to construct one — so every served read's user-pattern access IS the kernel-refusing chokepoint and the kernel-config reads stay confined to single-answer hands (the same shape `federation.ts` gets for its allow-list). The DO keeps thin RPC stubs (the RPC contract io.ts calls) over those functions. That made the old per-block `isKernelPattern` guard in `renderBlockHtml` provably redundant (a kernel-named block just reads back empty through `servedQuery`); it was deleted, leaving one chokepoint instead of a guard to forget per block type. The same redundancy retired `getSharedEntry`'s old hand-rolled `isKernelPattern` guard: its entry read now goes through `servedQuery` (which refuses kernel patterns at the engine AND binds the id, so no SQL-identifier injection), exactly as the render path's per-block guard was retired — the `patternExists`/`Number.isInteger(id)` checks survive only as a clean early not-found, never as the security gate. Because trust is fixed by the constructor (and the engine flag is required, no default), a NEW serve path can't silently inherit kernel access; it fails CLOSED. `context-capability totality` guards that the split can't rot back into a trust-defaulting factory. This replaced a block-list of scattered per-sink `isKernelPattern` checks that failed open. The read totality is the served-entry-point enumeration in `security.test.ts`, the analogue of `policy.test.ts` for writes. Instance identity is configuration, not request data: `currentHost()` is authoritative on `WORKER_HOST` and IGNORES the inbound `Host`, so an attacker cannot poison a capability URL (`upload_url`/`page_url`/`og_image`) by sending a spoofed `Host` on an unauthenticated request (e.g. a `/ws` upgrade). Cross-hive (foreign-URI) resolution lives in its own module (`federation.ts`), the one place that sends THIS hive's access token (`?token=` → `Authorization: Bearer`) to another origin. Its token-send is CO-LOCATED with the allow-list consent check in a single function (`federatedResolve`) precisely so the approved host and the contacted host can never drift apart: a token is attached only to a request whose host is BOTH not `isBlockedFederationHost` (SSRF block) AND `isHostAllowed` (the `_federation_hosts` consent allow-list), and that pair is re-validated on the INITIAL request AND on EVERY redirect hop, in lockstep with the fetch loop. Splitting the gate from the fetch — across modules or call sites — would let a future edit move one without the other; here they move as a unit. The DO hands the module a NARROW `FederationContext` — only the bound allow-list lookup (`isHostAllowed`, wrapping `_federation_hosts`, never `db`) + `errorJson` — so federation cannot read anything else; `resolve` stays on the DO and decides local vs. federated before dispatching here. This is the security analysis's "condition #2".

### Session  `entities/Session`
The per-session McpAgent Durable Object that speaks the MCP protocol and proxies tool calls to the hive over RPC.

_why:_ SessionDO is one Durable Object per MCP session: it handles the MCP protocol (tools, resources, init instructions) and proxies to the single HiveDO over RPC, keeping protocol concerns out of the data substrate. Tool metadata lives once in `tools.ts` as the SSOT feeding both MCP registration and the `/api/tools` frontend, so the agent-facing surface can't drift between the two. That "can't drift" is enforced, not asserted: the `tools SSOT totality` test statically reconciles every `.tool(`/`.registerTool(` call in `session.ts` against the `TOOLS` rows in both directions — a tool registered inline without a row (as `render` once was, making it a live MCP tool invisible to `/api/tools`) or a stale row with no registration fails the build. The session stamps the authenticated actor onto writes from its OAuth props so attribution is enforced at the protocol edge.

- session.ts imports agents/mcp
- tools.ts exists at this node
- session.ts imports ./tools
- boundary "tool-registry SSOT totality" at TOOLS via test "tools SSOT totality"

_files:_ `session.ts`, `tools.ts`

### Features  `entities/features`
Per-feature manifests that FEED the scattered registries from one declaration; composers derive each registry from the `FEATURES` array.

_why:_ A "feature" is the extensibility keystone, and today its footprint is smeared across registries a forker's agent must find and edit in lockstep: post-mutate effects (`entities/Hive/effects.ts`), HTTP routes (`src/index.ts`), MCP tools (`entities/Session/tools.ts`), kernel patterns + DDL (`entities/Hive/schema.ts`), write-policy class (`entities/Hive/policy.ts`), system docs, and the coherence spec. The `Feature` type collects all of those contributions into ONE co-located, typed declaration; the composers in `compose.ts` DERIVE each registry from the hand-maintained `FEATURES` barrel (`index.ts`). Adding a feature is then: create one dir + add one import line to the barrel — its whole footprint legible in the manifest instead of scattered. `effects` was the first registry wired end-to-end; `routes` is the second: `PATTERN_EFFECTS` in `effects.ts` is `composeEffects(FEATURES)`, and the route table in `src/index.ts` is `[...CORE_ROUTES, ...composeRoutes(FEATURES)]` rather than one hand-written literal. The `documents` feature owns its `/f/*` upload + serve edges and the `pages` feature owns its `/page/*` serve + OG edges, declared in their manifests (handlers still imported from the I/O adapter layer, `shared/Routing/routes/io.ts` — the manifest declares the routing rows, not the handler bodies). So a new side-effecting pattern, or a new HTTP edge for these features, is a feature manifest — not another entry in a central map. Route ORDER is load-bearing and preserved: the router matches in declaration order (first match wins), and feature routes are appended AFTER `CORE_ROUTES`, so a feature route can never shadow a core route. The moved patterns (`/f/...`, `/page/...`) share no prefix with any retained core route (`/o/`, `/p/`, `/marketplace*`, etc.), so the move changes no match outcome — confirmed by the route/document/page tests staying green. Each route's `backendPrefix` travels with its declaration into `BACKEND_PREFIXES`, so a moved route's SPA-fallback exclusion is derived from the manifest, not re-hardcoded in `src/index.ts`. Patterns + migrations are the third and fourth registries wired end-to-end: each feature owns its PATTERN STRUCTURE — the kernel-pattern DDL/facets/index and any feature-specific schema migration — as PURE DATA in its dir (`<name>/schema.ts`, type-only imports, no manifest code), and `schema.ts` builds `KERNEL_TABLES = [...CORE_KERNEL_TABLES, ...composePatterns(FEATURES)]` while its boot migration pile gains a tail loop over `composeMigrations(FEATURES)`. The `documents` feature owns the `_documents` table + its v12 extraction-columns migration; the `pages` feature owns the `_pages` table + path index. The move is byte-identical: every consumer of `KERNEL_TABLES` (the boot DDL loop, `_fields` seeding, the audit triggers, and crucially `verifyFieldsIntegrity` — the DDL↔`_fields` drift oracle — plus `verifyWritePolicyTotality`) reads the COMPOSED array, so a feature pattern is indistinguishable from a core one and an existing hive sees no schema diff at boot. The feature `schema.ts` files stay PURE DATA so they share the leaf discipline of the `*/security.ts` siblings (the structure half of "a feature owns its schema," beside the security half). The kernel PRE-MUTATION HOOKS are the fifth registry, completing "a feature owns its kernel pattern": the `_documents` create validation (title required) + its system-managed immutable bookkeeping columns live in `documents/hooks.ts`, and the `_pages` write-time hook (URL-safe path + block-palette validation + the kernel-pattern exfil guard) lives in `pages/hooks.ts`. A feature declares these in its manifest's `hooks` slot; `kernel.ts` renames its hand-written literals to `CORE_ON_CREATE`/`CORE_ON_WRITE`/`CORE_IMMUTABLE` and derives the EXPORTED `ON_CREATE`/`ON_WRITE`/`IMMUTABLE` as `mergeDisjoint(CORE_*, compose*(FEATURES))`. ENFORCEMENT does NOT move — `applyKernelRules` (the one chokepoint every mutate runs through) reads the EXPORTED composed maps, so the validation fires byte-for-byte as before (confirmed by the document title/immutability + page block-exfil tests staying green); only the DECLARATION moves into the feature dir, exactly as `effects` compose into `PATTERN_EFFECTS` but fire at the mutate chokepoint. The hook bodies are code, so `<dir>/hooks.ts` imports ONLY TYPES from `kernel.ts` (the hook signature types + `ImmutableRule` shape) — type imports are erased at runtime, so the `kernel.ts → FEATURES → manifest → hooks` back-edge is type-only and adds NO runtime cycle (`dpdm -T`, which strips type-only edges, shows the same single pre-existing runtime cycle before and after). `mergeDisjoint` mirrors policy.ts: a feature hook for a CORE pattern throws at module load, so a feature can never silently override a core invariant. Composition for `effects`/`tools`/`writePolicy`/`routes` runs at MODULE LOAD (static tables); `patterns`/`migrations`/`systemDocs` compose at BOOT (they touch the DB). The composers fail LOUDLY on collision (two features over one pattern's effect, a duplicate migration version, a route/tool/pattern name clash) rather than silently last-write-wins — a malformed manifest can't quietly shadow another feature; a feature↔core pattern-name clash is caught by policy.ts's `mergeDisjoint` at module load. The fail-CLOSED write-policy default is preserved: a feature pattern declared without a write-policy entry still resolves to System/denied, never silently agent-writable. System docs stay a single source (`http-io.md` spans egress/publications/documents/ingress, so it isn't split per-feature); the remaining registries (`tools`, `systemDocs`) keep ONE source of truth each until they adopt their composer (documented landing spots in `compose.ts`), so this migration adds the seam without duplicating definitions.

### Auth  `shared/Auth`
Credential primitives — multi-member passkeys and scoped access/register tokens — isolated as pure db-accessor functions.

_why:_ Auth primitives (passkeys + access/register/auth tokens) are isolated as pure db-accessor functions so credential concerns stay separate from the cognitive substrate; the multi-row passkey model (one credential per member, NULL = bootstrap owner) exists because one shared hive is authenticated into by several people each acting as themselves. `resolveRegisterToken` deliberately re-validates scope/owner/roster at setup/consume time — independent of how the token's fields were set — because an adversarial review showed mint-time checks alone could be bypassed by a post-create constraints update to mount an owner-takeover, and a malformed member-less token must be unusable rather than defaulting to the owner sentinel. Access tokens are stored HASHED at rest (`hashToken`, SHA-256): `findAccessToken` hashes the presented value and compares digests, mint stores only the digest (the raw token is shown once), and a boot migration hashes any legacy plaintext token in place. So a read of an `_access_tokens` row — a `query`, a `search` hit, a leaked DO snapshot — discloses only a digest, never a usable bearer. This is a deliberate exception to "store truth once": the secret's preimage is never persisted, which neuters the entire "a token reached a read sink" class independent of which sink leaks. Because the column holds a digest, every lookup that needs the token is async (`crypto.subtle.digest`), which is why these accessors return Promises.

_works when:_
- credentials.ts exists at this node
- passkey.ts exists at this node
- passkey.ts imports @simplewebauthn/server

_files:_ `credentials.ts`, `passkey.ts`

### IO  `shared/IO`
Outbound and inbound adapters: derived publication renderers, web-URL resolution with caching, git pack assembly, and text extraction.

_why:_ IO holds the adapters that move data across the hive's boundary, kept as focused single-purpose modules so each owns one concern. Publications render live pattern projections at request time (never stored) per the "data is destiny" doctrine; `web.ts` caches adapter-fetched content as durable memory with a re-fetch-horizon TTL and refuses blocked hosts; `extract.ts` splits inline text extraction from async PDF extraction off the response path because only the DO has `waitUntil`, capping extracted text to stay under the entry size limit.

- web.ts exists at this node
- git.ts exists at this node
- extract.ts exists at this node

_files:_ `extract.ts`, `git.ts`, `og-png.ts`, `publications.ts`, `web.ts`

### Routing  `shared/Routing`
Declarative HTTP dispatch and session machinery: pattern-matched route table plus constant-time, revocable session auth helpers.

_why:_ The router is the worker's declarative HTTP dispatch (method, pattern, auth gate, param constraints matched in declaration order) with handlers grouped by domain under `routes/`, so the full routing surface stays scannable. Its auth helpers are security-load-bearing: `timingSafeEqual` is constant-time to close a timing-attack finding on secret/token/signature checks, and session cookies carry a random sid plus a KV-stored epoch so every session can be revoked without rotating `MNEMION_SECRET`, while encoding the actor backward-compatibly so deploys don't force a re-login.

_works when:_
- router.ts exists at this node
- router.ts imports ../core/constants
- routes/auth.ts exists at this node
- routes/io.ts exists at this node
- routes/io.ts imports ../router

_files:_ `router.ts`, `auth.ts`, `canvas.ts`, `dev.ts`, `io.ts`, `marketplace.ts`, `pages.ts`

### Core  `shared/core`
Cross-cutting primitives shared by both the worker and the SPA: product identity, the declarative UI palettes (view / format / block / chart) an agent authors against, and dev-only seed data.

_why:_ Core is the layer both runtimes depend on but neither owns, so it carries zero env-specific imports and stays pure data — that purity is what lets the same module validate a write in the worker and render it in the SPA without forking. Its center of gravity is the agent-authorable UI: `view-palette` (how a pattern renders), `format-palette` (how a value renders), `block-palette` (how a page composes), and the chart pair (`chart-spec` + `chart-svg`). These are the canonical instances of the "self-enforcing declarations" doctrine — one declarative table that is simultaneously the spec an agent reads, the validator the kernel derives (`validateViewSpec`/`validateBlocks`/`validateFormatsMap`, fail-closed at the mutate chokepoint), and the totality oracle the SPA's `Record<…Id, Component>` enforces at compile time. The agent composes UI from these tables as data, never as code, which is what makes live agent-authored rework safe. The chart layer is deliberately split so one spec drives two renderers: `chart-spec` is the single home for the mark set, the categorical color palette, and the long→wide series pivot, and both the in-hive Recharts renderer and the server SVG renderer (`chart-svg`, for published pages and OG cards) derive from it — so a dataset reads identically in-hive and on a public page. `constants` keeps product identity (`PRODUCT_NAME`, `URI_SCHEME`, `uri()`) in one place so the scheme is never hardcoded. `dev-seed` is gated and runs only in the DO constructor under `DEV_SEED`; it writes via raw SQL (trusted, bypassing the kernel hook), so its contents must stay valid against these same palettes by hand — it is inert in production.
